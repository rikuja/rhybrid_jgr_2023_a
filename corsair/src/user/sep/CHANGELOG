sep_propagate.cpp

Bug fix, missing return statement messed up
profiler output.

sep_particle_scatterer.cpp

Bug fix, evaluateNumberOfSubsteps assumed particles to be protons,
which sometimes caused simulations with other ion species to crash.

sep_operator_spatial_lineout_energy_spectrum.h
sep_operator_spatial_lineout_energy_spectrum.cpp

It is now possible to plot ion energy spectra on separate variables.
Previously all ion species were included in the same energy spectrum.

Minor changes to other files.
