/** A class for writing log messages in parallel. MPILogger functions in 
 * the same way as standard C++ input streams, i.e. you insert values by 
 * using the stream input operator <<.
 * 
 * There is one major difference between MPILogger and standard C++ input 
 * streams: the contents of MPILogger are not flushed/written into the output file 
 * when endl or flush are inserted. Instead, one has to insert manipulator write,
 * defined in mpilogger.h, into the stream. 
 *
 * This is because MPILogger actually 
 * uses a stringstream buffer internally, and C++ standard manipulators are just 
 * passed on to the stringstream as-is. It is not possible to detect when endl 
 * or flush are inserted, because they have the same function signature as other 
 * manipulators (such as showpos). In principle it is possible to define new manipulators 
 * endl and flush here in the same manner as write, but then wrapper functions would 
 * need to be written for all standard C++ manipulators because compilers think that
 * std::endl and user-defined endl as ambiguous, i.e. compilers cannot decide which 
 * function should be linked.
