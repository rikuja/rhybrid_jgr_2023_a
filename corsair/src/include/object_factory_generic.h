/** Generic Object factory. Object factory is a class that, upon request, 
 * creates new objects. Object factory does not now what kind of objects it 
 * can create, user must provide necessary blueprints by registering maker functions
 * at runtime. Makers are actually wrappers that simply call class constructors.
 * In reality an object factory can make objects of single type, which is given 
 * as template parameter.
 * 
 * In Corsair object factories are used to create grid builders, particle accumulators, 
 * injectors, etc. Object factories are stored in object_factories.h file.
 * 
 * Note that one cannot use named variables in declarations, i.e., it is invalid 
 * to declare an std::map as "std::map<std::string name,bool value>". Correct way
 * to declare it is "std::map<std::string,bool>". In a similar manner a map 
 * containing a function pointer has to be declared as "std::map<std::string,PRODUCT* (*)()>".
 * This is synonymous to first defining an alias for function pointer "typedef PRODUCT* (*ProductMaker)()",
 * and then declaring "std::map<std::string,ProductMaker>". However, the typedef below 
 * depends on a template parameter and thus cannot be defined outside ObjectFactoryGeneric, 
 * so we stick to the long version of map declarations.
