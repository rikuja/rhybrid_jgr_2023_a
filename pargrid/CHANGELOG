*************************************

Added a new function that can be used to check that all processes
have succeeded in doing something. Each process calls it with their
local true/false values, and the function returns true only if all
processes called it with value true.

*************************************

DataWrapper was updated to include element byte size stored in dynamic
array. This was a necessary change to make restarting possible.

UserDataStatic and UserDataDynamic now contain string representation of the 
stored data. These were added to make restarting possible.

New functions were added to ParGrid to get more information on the
data stored in ParGrid arrays. These new functions are used in
restarting simulations.

Two outdated functions were removed.
